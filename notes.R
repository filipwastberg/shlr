## Notes

#' player stats are only returned for top 10 players. This doesnt make any sense.
#' If the amount of information returned is a concern then it would make more sense
#' to return player statistics for one team at the time

#' Top 10 goalkeepers does not return keepers per team, only per season
#' furthermore the documentation is wrong, it suggests that you can sort
#' by assists on a goalkeeper, which I am pretty sure you can't
#'
